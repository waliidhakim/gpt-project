  p Hi #{firstName} #{lastName},
  p We have noticed that you often join parties without playing. 
  p I would like to remind you that our policy states that you must not create or join a party if you do not intend to play... .
  P You already have #{nbrWarnings} warnings; with three warnings, you will no longer be able to access our platform.
  P Thank you for your understanding.
